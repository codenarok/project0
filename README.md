# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is a website that shows the top three team of three football league tables and relevant news underneath the tables.
I added 4 additional pages and pictures in the main page sends the user to the relevant pages as well. 
My navigation bar consists of lists and league tables are made of tables. Images are added.
I used class and id selectors on the index.html page for div and span.
I used mobile responsive query such as "width: 100%" in css and also bootstrap helped to make the containers and navigation mobile responsive.
I used CSS variable and nesting in the style1.css file. I used a CSS inheritance in the contact us page to make the e-mail address blue.
